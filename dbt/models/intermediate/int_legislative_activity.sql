-- GRAIN: one row per member x activity.
--
-- Unions bills and amendments into a single activity feed, each row tied to a
-- target district member. is sent into the mart after joining with member-county data.
--
-- Bills are linked to the member who sponsored or cosponsored them.
--
-- Amendments link via their parent bill — so each amendment fans out to one row
-- per member connected to that bill. The relationship column captures whether
-- the member personally sponsored the amendment or just owned the parent bill.
--
-- bill_title is always the parent bill title. amendment_title is null for bills.
--
-- member_id is always the target-district member. amendment_sponsor_id is whoever
-- proposed the amendment. If the amendment sponsor isn't a
-- target district member, their name won't appear; that's intentional since the
-- grain is target district member x activity, not amendment sponsor x activity.
--
-- RELATIONSHIP VALUES:
--   'sponsor'                           — member sponsored the bill
--   'cosponsor'                         — member cosponsored the bill
--   'amendment_sponsor'                 — member sponsored the amendment
--   'sponsored bill received amendment' — member's bill received this amendment
