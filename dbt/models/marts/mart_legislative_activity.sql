-- mart_legislative_activity.sql
--
-- GRAIN: one row per county x target_member x activity.
--
-- Filter by county_fips or county_name to see all legislative activity for
-- that county's House members.
--
-- county_fips is the full 5-digit FIPS (state + county) e.g. '13047'.
-- activity_id and activity_title are unified convenience fields — use these
-- for filtering, display, and aggregation rather than bill_id/amendment_id.
-- bill_title is the parent bill title for both bills and amendments.
-- amendment_title is null for bills.
-- bill_status / bill_latest_action_* reflect the CURRENT status of the parent
-- bill (point-in-time snapshot, no history). Amendments inherit their parent
-- bill's status. Use bill_status for aggregation, bill_latest_action_text for detail.
-- amendment_sponsor_*_if_target is only populated when the amendment sponsor
-- is themselves a target-district member.
--
-- RELATIONSHIP VALUES:
--   'sponsor'                           — member sponsored the bill
--   'cosponsor'                         — member cosponsored the bill
--   'amendment_sponsor'                 — member sponsored the amendment
--   'sponsored bill received amendment' — member's bill received this amendment
--
-- Use COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id) not COUNT(*) when aggregating — the same
-- activity appears once per county and once per member.
