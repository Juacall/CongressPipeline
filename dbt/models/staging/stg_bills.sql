-- stg_bills.sql
--
-- Clean and rename raw_bills.
-- One row per member-bill relationship — a bill appears once per connected member.
-- member_relationship is either 'sponsor' or 'cosponsor'.
--
-- BILL STATUS (current status only):
--   latest_action_date / latest_action_text are the bill's most-recent action as
--   reported by the Congress API — a point-in-time snapshot overwritten on each
--   ingestion run (no status history is retained).
--   bill_status is a coarse, derived category for aggregation. It is a heuristic
--   over latest_action_text; always fall back to latest_action_text for detail.
